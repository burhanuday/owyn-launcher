Owyn(Only What You Need) launcher is a minimal launcher for android


## What I need from my launcher..
* A clean interface
* A clock
* A searchable list of apps
* Easy access to my favorite apps
* Ability to uninstall apps


## Install
Not available on play store and never will be.
Grab an apk from the releases section and install it.


## Build it yourself
Make sure you have flutter installed on your system.

```
flutter build apk --split-per-abi
```

This will build apks in `build/app/outputs/apk/release/`.
